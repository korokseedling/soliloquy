## Visual Style Reference

--ar 16:9
In expressionist painterly style with visible, constructed brushwork, depict an urbane scene from the point of view of a stray cat and with the back of the cat's head peeking out at the bottom, the composition details analogizes the description of the emotion neologism.
Brushwork & Materiality: Textured strokes—impasto passages and gestural marks that create faceted, almost geological planes. Let warm undertones break through cooler surface colors as though emotion is surfacing through.

On the right side of the composition, incorporate a stylized glassmorphic definition panel matching the emotional theme. The ratio of right panel: left image area is 1:2. The panel contains an emotion neologism with its definition, using a calligraphic font for the neologism itself—rendered with visible brushstroke texture, ink bleed, and the gestural energy of traditional calligraphy. Below this, provide the etymology, followed by the definition in elegant serif.
