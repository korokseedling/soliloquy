# Dictionary Card Visual Prompt Template

**Purpose:** This template defines the visual style for dictionary-style neologism cards with expressionist cards.

## Visual Style Reference

--ar 16:9
In expressionist painterly style with visible, constructed brushwork, depict an urbane scene from the point of view of a stray cat observing from a distance, the composition details analogizes the description of the emotion neologism.
Brushwork & Materiality: Textured strokes—impasto passages and gestural marks that create faceted, almost geological planes. Let warm undertones break through cooler surface colors as though emotion is surfacing through.

On the right side of the composition, incorporate a stylized definition panel matching the emotional theme. The panel contains an emotion neologism with its definition, using a calligraphic font for the neologism itself—rendered with visible brushstroke texture, ink leak, and the gestural energy of traditional calligraphy. Below this, provide the etymology, followed by the definition in elegant serif.

## Color Palette & Atmosphere

**Warm Undertones:** Ochre, burnt sienna, raw umber breaking through surface layers—as though buried emotion is pushing through painted skin.

**Cooler Surface Colors:** Violet, blue-green, gray-green, slate—the outer emotional shell that holds or conceals.

**Lighting Philosophy:** Chiaroscuro with dramatic contrast—deep shadows with defined edges meeting pools of warm or cold light. Light reveals psychological truth; shadow guards it.

**Background Aesthetic:** Neo-noir realism—hyperreal, cinematically lit urban environments with gritty specificity. Sodium lights on wet pavement, neon reflections in puddles, empty bus stops under fluorescent hum, HDB corridors at dusk. The mundane made mysterious through light.

# Example Pattern

## Dépaysement: The Disorienting Beauty of Being Foreign

**Visual Concept:**
From the point of view of a stray cat perched on a rusty fire escape, looking down at a narrow alley in an unfamiliar city at twilight—the scene analogizes Dépaysement, the disorienting but potentially enriching feeling of being a foreigner; cultural displacement.

**Composition & Scene:**

In expressionist painterly style with visible, constructed brushwork, depict an urbane alley scene bathed in conflicting light sources—warm amber from a nearby window, cool blue-green from a distant streetlamp, violet shadows pooling between.

Foreground: The cat's vantage point—rusty metal grating, peeling paint, a forgotten potted plant. Below, cobblestones glisten with recent rain, reflecting fragmented light. A lone figure stands beneath a hanging lantern, reading unfamiliar street signs—posture slightly uncertain, yet open.

Middle Ground: Layered urban architecture—mismatched buildings leaning into each other, laundry hanging between windows, foreign script on shop signs glowing softly. Everything feels familiar in shape but foreign in detail. Doorways glow with warm interiors that the viewer cannot enter.

Background: Dissolves into atmospheric haze—the city continues beyond comprehension, lights merging into bokeh, forms suggesting depth without clarity. The unknown stretches infinitely.

**Brushwork & Materiality:**

Textured, impasto strokes on the foreground cobblestones—each stone a thick, faceted plane catching light differently. Gestural marks for the hanging laundry and neon signs—quick, energetic, alive. Warm ochre and burnt sienna break through the cooler slate and blue-green surface, as though the emotional warmth of potential enrichment surfaces beneath the disorientation.

Chiaroscuro lighting: Deep shadow where the alley narrows, brilliant warm light spilling from the window (almost too inviting), cold streetlamp creating a blue-green halo around the lone figure. Shadows have defined edges—psychological boundaries between known and unknown.

Neo-noir realism in details: The texture of wet stone, the specific glow of sodium vapor lights, the authentic clutter of urban life—cigarette butts, a discarded newspaper in foreign script, a cat's green eyes glowing in shadow (the observer made visible).

**Right Panel:**

Stylized definition panel on right side, matching the scene's twilight ambiguity:

**Dépaysement** (in calligraphic font with visible brushstroke texture, ink bleeding slightly into the background as though words themselves are displaced)

/day-pay-zee-mahn/

**Etymology:** From French *dépayser* (dé- "remove from" + pays "country/homeland")—to be removed from one's country; the state of feeling foreign.

**Definition:** The disorienting but potentially enriching feeling of being a foreigner; cultural displacement. That liminal vertigo when surrounded by unfamiliar language, architecture, and rhythm—where confusion and wonder occupy the same breath.
